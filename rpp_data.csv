The original questionnaire wording and format will be replicated exactly. The authors raised the concern that the scenario given in the questionnaire (about to being in a lecture class) may be more relatable to undergraduates than to other, non-student demographics. If so, theoretically, the effect of tempting fate could be attenuated. Potentially, also, our subjects could exhibit floor or ceiling effects not seen in the original sample if they perceive a substantially lower or higher baseline probability of being called on in class. An additional problem suggested by the authors is the possibility that an online environment may not allow adequate control of cognitive load, since participants are likely to have more environmental distractions than they would in a traditional lab setting.

Consideration of the ethnic group of the participants in the design of a future study could address issues such as whether particular ethnic groups not only recognize but evaluate the expressions labelled as pride by Tracy and Robins (and recognised by an American student sample) as pride and not arrogance or contempt (or happiness/self-satisfaction). The other key variation was that we presented the experiment materials on a desktop computer screen rather than using a large projector onto a screen. Once identified participants could move to the next image rather than be required to watch each static image for 30 seconds (which may have been done because the images were presented to groups by Tracy & Robins?). The size of image may have made specific differences slightly more difficult to judge. However, many people are used to judging emotions and recognizing them reading online newspapers, for example. It also wasn't clear from the Tracy and Robins (2008) study 4 whether they presented the images on the projector to random groups (e.g., in a lab class type setting) rather than individuals.

The original study was conducted in Israel with participants from that country and with stimulus materials presented in Hebrew _ probably the participantsÍ native language. Although the replication authors used a translator fluent in both Hebrew and English languages, these linguistic and cultural differences are still potentially significant factors in moderating the results of this replication study. Even though every effort was made to assure equivalency between the original Hebrew words and the English words used in the replication, it is still possible that the cultural meaning of the achievement words was more profound in the context of the Hebrew language in the Israeli culture relative to the English language in the American culture. Similarly, although participants in both studies were enrolled in an institution of higher learning, the sample from the original study was somewhat older (M = 23.9 years) than the participants in the replication study (M = 19.65, SD = 1.1). In addition, the proportion of female participants was higher in the replication study (74.8% vs. 60.5%). Although implicit learning and priming are typically less affected by demographic variables, such as age and gender, it is possible that the cultural differences described above and these other demographic variables together could be important moderating factors that affected the failure to replicate the primary finding from the original study. For example, given that all participants were students in an institution of higher learning, being older, and possibly more mature and/or focused, the participants in the original study may have been more affected by the priming condition than those in the replication study.",Not at all similar,Slightly similar,Somewhat challenging,Results were exactly as anticipated,X,1,No data used was pre-existing,Clinical,86,t,is,1,84,2.09,prep,0.92,0.039641746,0.039641746,,0.222330235,158,t,is,1,156,1.318,is,0.189,0.189435742,0.189435742,,0.104941786,,independent samples t-test,Independent samples t-test,,1,0,1,84,156,0.147449157,1,1
