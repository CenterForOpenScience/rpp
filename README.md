# Reproducibility project
Repository for working on the Reproducibility project. Here we develop the analyses for Tilburg. The Github repository also operates as the issue tracker for the Tilburg people on the analysis committee.

The data are contained in this repository and were retrieved from the [Masterdata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IXGYUvt9vb64FyXP2Wlf03X5lPo_AvhQOsNs6w84dk/edit#gid=0) sheet on March 23, 2015. Differences might arise due to changes made subsequently to the Masterdata.
