# Reproducibility project
Repository for working on the Reproducibility project. Here we develop the analyses for Tilburg. The Github reposoity also operates as the issue tracker for those on the analysis committee.

The goal is to make one self-contained file for running the analyses. Note that this *will* require having Rtools installed, considering `devtools` will be used to load several packages.
